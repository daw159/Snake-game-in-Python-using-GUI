# Snake-game-in-Python-using-GUI
This is a classic Snake Game built with Python Tkinter. The player controls the snake with arrow keys, eats food to grow, and scores points. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself. It features a score display and smooth game loop using Tkinterâ€™s after() function.
